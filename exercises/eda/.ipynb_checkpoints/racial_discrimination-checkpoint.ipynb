    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "This, however, does not necessarily mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success. The dataset contains 65 columns, meaning that we have 50+ other reported resume features that could be more/less significant in callback success (including correlations amongst said features, too). In my opinion, the quick and dirty thing to do in this situation would be to standardize all of the other features in the dataset, perform logistic regression (with `call` as the variable being predicted), and examine the relative magnitudes of the coefficients returned via regression. Other, more sophisticated methods exist (Boruta is one that I've tinkered with in the past) for such a task, but regardless, the important takeaway here is that one should not draw conclusions before examining all of the available data!"
